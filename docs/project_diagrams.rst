Quiz Application - Project Diagrams

===================================



This document provides an overview of the various diagrams created for

the Quiz Application project. These diagrams help visualize different

aspects of the system design, architecture, and project planning.

Data Flow Diagrams

------------------



Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) illustrate how data moves through the Quiz

application. We provide three levels of DFDs to show increasing levels

of detail.



Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The context diagram shows the system as a single process interacting

with external entities.

   :alt: Level 0 DFD



   Level 0 DFD



**Key Elements:** - The Quiz System is represented as a single process -

External entities include Users, Administrators, and the Database - Data

flows show the high-level interactions between entities



Level 1 DFD

~~~~~~~~~~~



The Level 1 DFD breaks down the system into its major processes and data

stores.

   :alt: Level 1 DFD



   Level 1 DFD



**Key Elements:** - Major processes: User Authentication, Quiz

Selection, Quiz Taking, Result Analysis, Admin Dashboard - Data stores:

User Database, Question Database, Results Database - Data flows showing

how information moves between processes and data stores



Level 2 DFD (Quiz Taking Process)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The Level 2 DFD provides a detailed view of the Quiz Taking process.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/dfd_level2.png

   :alt: Level 2 DFD



   Level 2 DFD



**Key Elements:** - Detailed sub-processes: Question Retrieval, Answer

Submission, Progress Tracking, Score Calculation - Data stores accessed

during quiz taking - Detailed data flows showing the complete

quiz-taking workflow



Use Case Diagram

----------------



The Use Case Diagram illustrates the interactions between users and the

system functionality.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/use_case_diagram.png

   :alt: Use Case Diagram



   Use Case Diagram



**Key Elements:** - Actor types: Anonymous User, Registered User, and

Administrator - Primary use cases for each actor type - Include and

extend relationships between use cases - System boundary defining the

scope of the application



Sequence Diagram

----------------



The Sequence Diagram shows the time-ordered interactions for the

quiz-taking process.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/sequence_diagram.png

   :alt: Sequence Diagram



   Sequence Diagram



**Key Elements:** - Participants: User, Browser UI, Quiz Controller,

Question Model, Database - Message sequence showing the complete

quiz-taking flow - Return messages indicating responses between

components - Activation bars showing when each component is active



Component Diagram

-----------------



The Component Diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the

application.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/component_diagram.png

   :alt: Component Diagram



   Component Diagram



**Key Elements:** - Architectural layers: Presentation, Controller,

Service, and Data Storage - Components within each layer - Interfaces

provided by components - Dependencies between components - Database

connections



Project Planning

----------------



The project planning diagrams provide insights into the project

schedule, task dependencies, and time estimation.



Three-Point Estimation

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



The Three-Point Estimation table shows optimistic, most likely, and

pessimistic time estimates for each project task.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/three_point_estimation.png

   :alt: Three-Point Estimation



   Three-Point Estimation



**Key Elements:** - Task breakdown with IDs - Three-point estimates

(Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic) - Expected duration calculation -

Standard deviation and variance values - Critical path identification



PERT Chart

~~~~~~~~~~



The PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) chart shows task

dependencies and the critical path.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/pert_chart.png

   :alt: PERT Chart



   PERT Chart



**Key Elements:** - Nodes representing project tasks - Edges showing

dependencies between tasks - Critical path highlighted in red - Early

start/finish and late start/finish times for each task - Slack time

calculation



Gantt Chart

~~~~~~~~~~~



The Gantt chart provides a timeline view of the project schedule.



.. figure:: diagrams/output/gantt_chart.png

   :alt: Gantt Chart



   Gantt Chart



**Key Elements:** - Horizontal bars representing task durations - Task

dependencies shown as arrows - Critical path tasks highlighted -

Three-point estimation uncertainty ranges - Timeline with day markers



Generating the Diagrams

-----------------------



All diagrams were generated programmatically using Python with the

following libraries: - Matplotlib - NetworkX - NumPy - Pandas



The code for generating these diagrams is available in the

``docs/diagrams/`` directory. To regenerate all diagrams, run:



.. code:: bash



   python docs/diagrams/generate_all_diagrams.py



Conclusion

----------



These diagrams provide a comprehensive visual representation of the Quiz

Applicationâ€™s design, architecture, and project plan. They serve as

valuable documentation for developers, stakeholders, and future

maintenance teams.

Analytics and Visualization
=========================

Last updated: 2025-05-08

Overview
--------

The Quiz Application includes comprehensive analytics and visualization features that help users
track their performance over time and get insights into their quiz-taking habits.

Analytics Features
-----------------

User Statistics Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The User Statistics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of a user's quiz performance:

* **Performance Over Time**: Line chart showing quiz scores over time, grouped by category
* **Performance by Category**: Bar chart showing average scores for each category
* **Quiz Length Distribution**: Pie chart showing the distribution of quiz lengths
* **Summary Statistics**: Key metrics including overall average, best category, and perfect scores

Visualizations
-------------

The analytics system uses the following Python data science libraries:

* **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
* **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations
* **seaborn**: For enhanced matplotlib visualizations with better default styling

Implementation
-------------

The analytics system is implemented through the ``UserStatsView`` class, which:

* Collects quiz attempt data for the logged-in user
* Transforms the data into pandas DataFrames
* Generates visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn
* Calculates summary statistics
* Passes the charts and statistics to the template for display

Code Example
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        # Get quiz attempts
        quiz_attempts = QuizAttempt.objects.filter(
            user=self.request.user,
            completed_at__isnull=False
        ).select_related('category')
        
        # Create DataFrame
        data = {
            'date': [],
            'category': [],
            'score_percentage': []
        }
        # Add data to the dictionary
        
        # Generate visualizations...

Data Sources
-----------

The analytics feature uses data from the following models:

* **QuizAttempt**: For quiz metadata and scores
* **QuizResponse**: For detailed response data
* **Category**: For category information
* **User**: For user identification

Future Enhancements
------------------

Planned enhancements to the analytics system include:

1. Predictive analytics to recommend areas for improvement
2. Comparative statistics against other users
3. Downloadable reports in PDF format
4. Advanced filtering and time-range selection
5. Custom chart creation
